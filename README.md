# POKEGAME
just a small game i made in python that uses python and json files to use the game itself 



to anyone who wants to play this you will have to pip a few things

pip ursina 
&
pip PIL

if they dont work im not sure if this game will even play , i am using vscode so if you use this it should work, and i downloaded python using microspft store
